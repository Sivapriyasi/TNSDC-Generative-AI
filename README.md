PROBLEM STATEMENT:
       Objective: Develop a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model to learn a low-dimensional representation of handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset.
       Image Reconstruction: Train the VAE to accurately reconstruct input images, enabling it to capture meaningful features of the dataset.
       Latent Space Exploration: Explore the learned latent space to generate new digit images and interpolate between different digit classes.
       Anomaly Detection: Utilize the VAE for anomaly detection by leveraging reconstruction error to identify outliers or unusual digit images in the dataset.
DESCRIPTION:
       A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) project aims to implement a machine learning model capable of learning meaningful representations of data in an unsupervised 
       manner. VAEs are a type of generative model that can generate new data samples similar to the training data. In short, the project involves training a 
       VAE architecture on a dataset to learn a latent space representation and then using this representation for tasks such as data generation,
       dimensionality reduction, or anomaly detection.
